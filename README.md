# George's Password Generator

The purpose of this challenge was to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The generated password lenght must be between 8-128 characters and consist of: lowercase, uppercase, numerical and/or special characters. In order to accomplish this, I needed to create a function to create a password which included several variables consisting of if and else statements with alert and prompt windows. I added a for loop as well to help randomize the characters of the generated password. I was successful in creating an application that generates random passwords using these tools.
